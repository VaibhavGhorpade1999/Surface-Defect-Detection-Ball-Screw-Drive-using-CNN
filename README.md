# Surface-Defect-Detection-Ball-Screw-Drive-using-CNN
## Abstract:
- The dataset contains of 21835 150x150 Pixel RGB images of the surface of Ball Screw Drives. 
- 11075 of these images are images without surface defects whereas the rest shows images with surface defects in form of so called pittings. 
- So the dataset is evenly split over the classes. Pittings result from surface disruption and can ultimately lead to the breakdown of the component. 
- To keep the availability of machines high it is important to find surface defects in time. 
- The here presented dataset gives researchers and practitioners the possibility to train and test models for the classification of surface defects on machine tool elements.

## Description:
- Images in "N" folder are images without defect whereas images with "P" folder are images showing Pittings.
